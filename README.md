## Dashboard Demo

## Goals of the Project:

1. Explore a Variables Details.
2. Detecting and Removing Missing Values.
3. Investigating and Converting data types.
4. Calculate basic Statistics like mean, median, mode. 
5. Visualize Distributions for the dataset.
6. Checking Outliers with a Boxplot.
7. Investigating Relationships between variables.
8. Build Random Forest Classification Model (all variables).
9. Test Results.
10. Enhancing Random Forest Classification with SMOTE Data Augmentation (class imbalance).
11. Test Results for Random Forest Classification with SMOTE Data Augmentation.
12. Random Forest with Feature Selection (reduced the number of required variables from 48 to approximately 12).
13. Testing the Random Forest Model with Sample Data.
